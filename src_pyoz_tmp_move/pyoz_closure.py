Module defining closure relations
revision of this file: 0.1.1

currently supported:
  hnc - HyperNetted Chain
  py - Percus-Yevick
  dummy - dummy function
  
in the whole program (except where stated otherwise), the numpy/scipy arrays are used. as
a result, all mathematical operations are done element-wise. this applies also for multiplication
of vectors and arrays.
