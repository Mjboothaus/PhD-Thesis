  module for performing various types of discrete transforms
  revision of this file: 0.1.4
  
  for the 3D-Fourier transformation, there is a normalization factor of 1/(2*pi)^3 involved
  then, the forward FT can be normalized  
    ft_3d_forward = 1/(2pi)^3
    ft_3d_inverse = 1
  or both FTs can be normalized, yielding unitary transformation
    ft_3d_forward = sqrt(1/(2pi)^3)
    ft_3d_inverse = sqrt(1/(2pi)^3)
  or the inverse FT can be normalized
    ft_3d_forward = 1
    ft_3d_inverse = 1/(2pi)^3
  
  when moving from 3d-fourier transform to fourier-bessel transformation (FBT), there's a factor
  of 4pi involved for both forward and inverse transforms
  the factor can probably be distributed 'freely' as well
  both factors within forward transformation
    ft_fb_forward = 16pi^2
    ft_fb_inverse = 1  
  factor distributed among forward and inverse transform 
    ft_fb_forward = 4pi
    ft_fb_inverse = 4pi
  or both factors within inverse transformation
    ft_fb_inverse = 16pi^2  
    ft_fb_forward = 1
  
  it's also important to note that
    F = FBT(f) = ft_3d_forward * ft_fb_forward * 1/k int_0^\infty f(r) r sin(kr) dr
    f = iFBT(F) = ft_3d_inverse * ft_fb_inverse * 1/r int_0^\infty f(k) k sin(kr) dr
  this can be written in terms of a Fourier-sinus tranform (FST)
    G = FST(g) = ft_fs_forward * int_0^\infty g(r)  sin(kr) dr
    g = iFST(G) = ft_fs_inverse int_0^\infty g(k)  sin(kr) dk
  i.e., we define new functions g = r*f and G=k*F and perform the FST, then divide by the k (forward)
  or r (inverse) and we have the FBT/iFBT result. this approach is used because the FST is easily
  performed using the standard FFT. one has to take care of the different pre-factors, of course.
  
  the continuous sinus transformations (forward and inverse) are normalized to 2/pi
  then, the forward FST can be normalized  
    ft_fs_forward = 2/pi
    ft_3d_inverse = 1
  or both FTs can be normalized, yielding unitary transformation
    ft_3d_forward = sqrt(2/pi)
    ft_3d_inverse = sqrt(2/pi)
  or the inverse FT can be normalized
    ft_3d_forward = 1
    ft_3d_inverse = 2/pi
  
  the following text is DST implementation dependent! it's necessary to check the implementation
  in the respective scientific library! use test_dst.py
  
  employed discrete sinus transformations routines are themselves normalized to the number of points
  i.e., there aren't any factors necessary => iDST(DST(f)) = f
  
  however, DST(f) is not the complete fourier-sinus transformation. it's necessary to 
  multiply it with the step size in real space, i.e., 
    F' = FST'(f) = DST(f) * dr
  where F' or FST' is the fourier-sinus transformation of f using discretely sampled data
  in order to get an equivalent of the exact continuous sinus transformation, we need
  to multiply with the respective constant factor
    F = FST(f) = ft_fs_forward * DST(f) * dr
  the same applies to the inverse transformation - it's necessary to multiply
  it with the step size in reciprocal space, i.e.,
    f' = iFST'(F) = iDST(F) * dk
  again, in order to get an equivalent of the exact continuous inverse sinus transformation,
  we have to multiply with the constant prefactor
    f = iFST(F) = ft_fs_inverse * iDST(F) * dr
  at this moment, it's clear that
    x = iFST(FST(f)) != f
  because
    x = ft_fs_inverse * dk * iDST(ft_fs_forward * DST(f) * dr) =
      = ft_fs_inverse * ft_fs_forward * dr * dk * f
  so at this point, we still don't have the correct FST/iFST pair
  in this program, dk = pi / (N dr), and therefore
    x = ft_fs_inverse * ft_fs_forward * dr * pi / (N * dr) * f = 
      = ft_fs_inverse * ft_fs_forward * pi * f / N
  this means, that although the discrete sinus transformation routine is normalized, the introduction of
  the dr, dk factors brings the number of points back into play.
  when the DST and iDST routines are checked against the fourier-sinus transform of a function where the
  solution is analytically known, the following information emerges.
  the function is, for example
    g = exp(-a * r**2) * sin(b * r)
  with the analytical FST
    G = exp(-1.0 * (k**2 + b**2)/(4.0 * a)) * sinh(b * k / (2.0*a)) / sqrt(2.0*a)
  where the unitary FST was used (sqrt(2/pi) for both forward and inverse transform.
  the result of the numerical procedure (as described above) has to be multiplied by the same FST prefactor 
  in order to get the same function
    sqrt(2/pi) * F = sqrt(2/pi) * FST(f) = sqrt(2/pi) * DST(f) * dr = G
  in order to get the f=g back, we need to multiply by the iFST prefactor and then take care of the N factor. as
  described above, the function we get in this way is
    x = ft_fs_inverse * ft_fs_forward * pi * f / N = 2/pi * pi * f / N = 2f/N
  therefore, we have to further multiply the result with N/2.
  we can, therefore, conclude that
  F = DST(f) r
  f = iDST(F) k N/2
  the factor of N/2 stays the same whatever normalization combination we use
