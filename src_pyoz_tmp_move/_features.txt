    * general features
          o bulk calculations for simple atomic/ionic systems (no atomic details in molecules and molecular ions) on McMillan-Mayer level
          o simple iteration scheme (direct Picard iteration)
          o improved iteration scheme (Newton-Raphson/conjugate gradients)
          o graphics output using Matplotlib
    * supported closure relations
          o Hypernetted Chain (HNC)
          o Percus-Yevick (PY)
    * supported interatomic potentials
          o hard spheres potential
          o Coulomb potential (used together with Ng-renormalization)
          o charge-induced dipole interaction
          o Lennard-Jones potential with σ and ε
          o potential of mean force from external file
    * supported thermodynamic properties
          o osmotic coefficient
          o isothermal compressibility
          o excess chemical potential
          o Kirkwood-Buff factor
    * output
