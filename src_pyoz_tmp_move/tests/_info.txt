test inputs for pyOZ
====================

directories contain test inputs for pyOZ together with 
reference output data (files with .orig extension)

for some interaction potentials (lj at the moment), i don't have 
any reliable benchmark data available. in other cases, pyOZ 
outputs are compared to data coming from trustworthy application(s). 

every directory contains the following 2 sets of data
    picard.*	using the simple picard iteration
    nrcg.*	using the enhanced nr/cg iteration

********************************************************************

hs
    hard spheres with HNC closure
    reliable data
    
hs_chg
    charged hard spheres with HNC closure
    reliable data

hs_chg_dip
